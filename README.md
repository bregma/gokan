Bringing Linux to its senses.

*gokan* is a library and service for a userspace API for various hardware and synthetic sensors.

A lot of modern hardware (for example, ultrabooks) have an ehanced awareness of their surroundings:
3D accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers (compasses), ambient light detectors, and so on.  On non-Android machines
there is the beginnings of support for these devices in teh Linux kernel, but the userspace-level support is
stinky soft sticky yellow crap.

This project is exploring an alternative way to provide sensors to userspace software.
