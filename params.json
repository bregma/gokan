{"name":"Gokan","tagline":"Bringing Linux to its senses.","body":"# Gokan\r\nA tool to use the various environmental sensors available on common hardware running Linux.\r\n\r\nMost \"ultrabook\" laptops have 3D gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers, lid position sensors, ambient light detectors, and so on.  None of these sensors are made available to userspace in any useful way.  What a waste!  Imagine what you could do if only your laptop knew where it was and where it was going!\r\n\r\n## Using Gokan\r\nThe Gokan project is still in its early days and does not yet have anythingh useful you can install and use.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nYou can help out.   Try contacting [bregma](https://github.com/bregma) for more information.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
